# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
In this Real world Problem on Bank Customer Churn Model you will learn the Data Encoding, Feature Scaling, Handling Imbalanced Data, Support Vector Machine Classifier and Grid Search for Hyperparameter tuning from scratch with detailed explanation of the concept.

 Customer churn is the percentage of customers who stopped purchasing your business's products or services during a certain period of time.

 So we are going to classify customers based on their target attributes for the customer churn prediction. 

*   **Data Encoding** - Data Encoding is an important pre-processing step in Machine Learning. It refers to the process of converting categorical or textual data into numerical format, so that it can be used as input for algorithms to process

*   **Feature Scaling** - Feature scaling is a method used to normalize the range of independent variables or features of data. In data processing, it is also known as data normalization and is generally performed during the data preprocessing step.

*   **Handling Imbalance Data** - Imbalanced data refers to those types of datasets where the target class has an uneven distribution of observations, i.e one class label has a very high number of observations and the other has a very low number of observations. So we are using the below two techniques for handling imbalance data.
    * Random Under Sampling Techniques
    * Random Over Sampling Techniques
*   **Support Vector Classifier** - A support vector machine (SVM) is a machine learning algorithm that uses supervised learning models to solve complex classification, regression, and outlier detection problems by performing optimal data transformations that determine boundaries between data points based on predefined classes, labels, or outputs.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search Algorithm** - We will improve the hyperparameters of the best performing models so that it can be improved further more. Grid Search uses a different combination of all the specified hyperparameters and their values and calculates the performance for each combination and selects the best value for the hyperparameters. This makes the processing time-consuming and expensive based on the number of hyperparameters involved.
